# docker-services

Docker containers for common system services like databases and local smtp servers.

I work on multiple enviroments like Mac OS and a variaty of linux operating systems. One of the common services I need to install in my local development machine are databases for our
applications such as our [AdoPiSoft](https://wwww.adopisoft.com) application and servers. Docker has made it so much easier to setup all these services for any system with this repository.

## System Requirements

- `docker`
- `make`

## Usage

```
git clone git@github.com:adonespitogo/docker-services.git ~/docker-services
cd ~/docker-services
cp .env.sample .env
```

The instructions below assumes you are using the default values in `.env` file.

-----

### MariaDB Service

To start `mariadb` server, type `make start_mariadb` inside the docker-services directory.

```sh
make start_mariadb
```

The default connection settings are:

```
host      = localhost
username  = root
password  = rootpass
port      = 3306
```

`PhpMyAdmin` is automatically started and can be accessed via [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) by default.

To stop mariadb server, type `make stop_mariadb`.

-----

### Postgres Service

To start `postgres` server, type `make start_postgres` inside the docker-services directory.

```sh
make start_postgres
```

The default connection settings are:

```
host      = localhost
username  = postgres
password  = postgres
port      = 5432
```

To manage your postgres server using `pgadmin4` visit http://localhost:8081

The default email/password for pgadmin4 is:

```
Email:      admin@pg.com
Password:   admin
```

Then select the pre-defined server `Servers > Local Server`. When a prompt appears to enter your postgres user password, type: `postgres`

This will automatically connect you to the running docker postgres server.

To stop the postgresql server, type `make stop_postgres`

-----

### Mailhog

To start `mailhog`, run `make start_mailhog`.

You can view the mailhog web interface at http://localhost:8025

To stop, use `make stop_mailhog`.
